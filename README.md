# Project Overview

## Identification of Brain Tumours from MRI Images using Machine Learning Techniques

This project aims to develop a machine learning-based system for the early detection and classification of brain tumours from MRI images. Motivated by personal experiences, it highlights the critical need for early and accurate diagnosis of brain tumours.

## Objective

Build an efficient and reliable infrastructure for the classification of brain tumours using machine learning techniques to assist in precise identification and treatment of malignant cells in brain MRI scans.

## Methods

- **Data Collection**: Use extensive MRI datasets, including T1-weighted scans.
- **Preprocessing**: Apply image augmentation and enhancement techniques to improve data quality.
- **Model Development**: Implement Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) and other machine learning algorithms for tumour detection and classification.
- **Evaluation**: Assess model performance using metrics such as accuracy, precision, and recall.

## Key Features

- **Automated Tumour Segmentation**: Use CNNs to accurately segment and classify tumour regions in MRI images.
- **Early Detection**: Focus on identifying tumours at an early stage to improve patient outcomes.
- **High Accuracy**: Achieve high levels of accuracy in tumour classification through rigorous testing and validation.

## Results

The proposed method demonstrated superior performance compared to existing techniques, achieving high accuracy rates in the classification of brain tumours across multiple datasets.

## Conclusion

This project provides a promising approach to brain tumour detection using machine learning, potentially aiding in early diagnosis and treatment, thereby improving the survival rates of patients with brain tumours.
